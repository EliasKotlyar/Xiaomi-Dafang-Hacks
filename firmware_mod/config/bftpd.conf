  #You can force bftpd to use a specific port range in passive mode.
  #Passive mode means that the client will open data connections
  #and the server stays 'passive'.
  #This option can be very useful with some firewall configurations.
  #Seperate values with "," and define ranges with "-".
  #bftpd will try to bind one of these ports in ascending order as
  #you specify them here.
  #If none of the given ports could be bound, the connection is
  #is refused. If you want to bind any free port in that case, add
  #"0" to the list.
  #PASSIVE_PORTS="10000,12000-12100,13000"
  PASSIVE_PORTS="0"

  #If PORT data connections should be opened from port 20, say yes here. You
  #will probably need this if your server is behind a firewall that restricts
  #outgoing packets from ports higher than 1024. Note that this may be a
  #security hole, as the server can not drop its root privileges completely
  #if you say yes here.

  #The password for the administration commands, encrypted (man mkpasswd).
  ADMIN_PASS="x"

  #With this option, you can put your entire FTP environment into a chroot
  #jail. Apart from security, this offers you the possibility of having
  #virtual users that don't exist in the system.
  #Additionally, you can make some kind of 'file pool' by creating a directory
  #with files which you can symlink from the users' homes (this means setting
  #DO_CHROOT=no in order for the users to be able to access that dir.
  #Note that you need the following files in your initial chroot directory:
  #/etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, /etc/group
  #On GNU systems, you will also need the NSS libraries in /lib.
  #INITIAL_CHROOT="/ftp"

  #The bftpdutmp file enables you to record user logins and logouts in
  #bftpd, which is useful for the administration interface (which is not
  #finished yet). You also need the file to be able to restrict the number
  #of users simultaneously logged on, and so on.
  #Note that the directory in which the file resides must already exist.
  #Set the option to "" if you do not want that. This is discouraged for normal
  #use, but can be helpful if you want to create a boot floppy or something.
  PATH_BFTPDUTMP="/var/run/bftpd/bftpdutmp"

  #This option controls the buffer size while transferring files.
  #If you are on a very fast network (fast meaning 100 Mbit/s or more),
  #you should set this to 64000 or something like that.
  #Transferring from localhost to localhost, I had a transfer speed of
  #approx. 15 MB/s with XFER_BUFSIZE=2048 and a speed of approx. 20 MB/s
  #with XFER_BUFSIZE=64000. You should not set big values for this if you have
  #slow (dialup) clients.
  # This option can also be used to (crudely) throttle back
  # transfer speeds. Setting this to a very low value
  # can slow transfer speeds.
  XFER_BUFSIZE="2048"


  # This variable controls whether the transfer buffer (see above option)
  # should change size as more (or less) clients connect to the server.
  # Setting this option to "yes" will put more work on your CPU, but
  # will avoid chewing up as much bandwidth as more people connect.
  # Setting this option to "no" is easier on the CPU, but may cause
  # your bandwidth to spike.
  CHANGE_BUFSIZE="no"



  # This option allows you to add a delay (in microseconds) to
  # the time between when one piece of data was sent
  # and when the next will be sent. This is to aid in
  # throttling bandwidth and applies to each client. The
  # throttling effects the DATA transfers only (not control
  # connections).
  # A value of zero (0) means there is no added delay.
  # A value of about 500000 (five hundred thousand) should
  # delay for about half a second.
  # These delays should be kept low to avoid triggering
  # data transfer timeouts.
  XFER_DELAY="0"

  # This option determines whether hidden files
  # ( files that start with a "." )
  # will be shown in a directory listing.
  # If this option is set to "yes", the client will be
  # able to see hidden files ONLY if they pass the "-a"
  # option to the list command. For example "ls -a".
  # If this option is set to "no", then hidden files are
  # never shown, regardless of whether "-a" is used.
  # Additionally, if we want the server to always send hidden
  # files to the client, whether they request hidden files or
  # not, set this to "always".
  SHOW_HIDDEN_FILES="no"

  # This option determines whether files not readable
  # to the ftp user will be shown in a directory listing.

  #When set to yes, this option makes the server allow data connections which
  #don't go to the client who initiated them.

  #Use Ratio if you want the client to send a file before he can get a file.

  #This option allows you to force files to be compressed
