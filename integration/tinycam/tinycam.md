## Integration in tinyCam

1. Download the [custom_vendors.xml](custom_vendors.xml) configuration file
2. Open tinyCam and go to settings -> Developer Settings -> Custom brand XML file -> Choose custom_vendors.xml
3. Restart tinyCam
4. Run tinyCam and select Brand -> XiaomiHack and Model -> Dafang EliasKotlyar

Note: Custom_vendors.xml 'file not found' error can happen due to tinycam not taking correct path from file manager - check it is not prefixed with 'document' etc.
